<h4 id="video-analysis">Video Analysis</h4>
<p><strong>Student A</strong><br />
Student A is one of the top two participants of our experiment. They had the physical note taking approach and achieved a score of 8.5/10 on our quiz. They kept pace with the video, sometimes take digital notes during lectures and prefer to study with both physical and digital notes for exams.</p>
<p><strong>Student B</strong> <br />
Student B is also one of the top two participants of our experiment. They had the digital note taking approach and achieved a score of 8.5/10 on our quiz. They kept pace with the video, sometimes take notes during lectures and prefer to study with physical notes for exams.</p>
<p><strong>Student C</strong> <br />
Student C was a relatively calm participant and wrote down quite a lot of notes throughout the duration of the video. Although they did make a comment on how they couldn’t read their own writing, they did relatively well, gaining 7/10 on the quiz. Student A was able to keep pace on the video while taking down physical notes. They sometimes takes down physical notes during lectures and prefer to study with both physical and digital notes during exams. </p>
<p><strong>Student D</strong><br />
Student D was one of the 2 participants who got the least points in our quiz, although they wrote down a decent amount of notes, they did not pay much attention to remembering certain points of the video. They stated they did not keep pace with the video during note taking. Though rarely, Student D prefers to use their tablet to take down notes during lectures and prefers to study using physical notes during exams.</p>
<p><strong>Student E</strong><br />
Student E was a calm participant achieving 7.5/10 of our quiz and wrote down quite a lot of physical notes during the video. We realised in their quiz session that we should have included a rating bar instead of a yes or no answer option for the “Were you able to keep pace with the video during note taking” section. They were the only participant to answer our two Bonus Questions correctly.Although Student E seemed like they kept pace during the session, they stated that they did not keep pace with the video. Student E sometimes takes down physical notes during lectures and studies with physical and digital notes for exams.</p>
<p><strong>Student F</strong><br />
Student F was the only participant who had watched the video prior to our experiment and achieved a 6/10 during our quiz. They were able to keep pace with the video, don’t take notes during lectures and study with digital notes.</p>
<p><strong>Student G</strong><br />
Student G achieved 6.5/10 on the quiz, He seemed to keep up and take a lot of notes on the digital note, Student G did not need the full minute of revision and seemed eager to continue on the quiz and is confident. Student G was quite hasty and did not read the questions properly, leaving us to prompt him to read the question.He believed the video was “too quick” for as his last comments. Student G is a person who rarely takes notes during lectures as He answered “I don't” on the question “how do you take notes”.</p>
<p><strong>Student H</strong><br />
Student H was another student who got the lowest score in our quiz. Although they are good at studying, they are not as good at note taking and therefore wrote down a small amount of digital notes. They did not keep pace with the video, do not take notes during lectures and study with digital notes.</p>
<p><strong>Student I</strong><br />
Student I achieved an overall of 6.5/10 on the quiz and it was slightly unfair during the beginning of the video as they were distracted from people walking and talking in the background and therefore didn’t catch the cashew/apple fact. They took down physical notes during our experiment and didn’t keep pace with the video. Student I sometimes takes physical notes during lectures and studies with both physical and digital notes for exams.</p>
<p><strong>Student J</strong><br />
Student J is another participant who got one of the top three scores of 8.5/10 on our quiz, taking a physical note taking approach. There is no video of their session but they thought the quiz was hard. They sometimes take physical notes during lectures and study with both physical notes during exams.</p>
<p><strong>Student K</strong><br />
Student K achieved 6.5/10 on our quiz by taking down digital notes. There was again no video of their session and they thought the quiz was hard. They noted that they would have preferred to have taken notes by pen and paper instead of by keyboard. They do not take down notes during lectures but study with both physical and digital notes for exams.</p></div>
