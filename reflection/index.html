<h2 id="team-members">Team Members</h2>
<p>We are just of dying students :(</p>
<h2 id="why-we-chose-this-project">Why we chose this project?</h2>
<p>As a team we decided that we wanted to research and analyze a topic that would further better our studies,
most groups were already speed testing keyboards and comparing screen sizes.
However, we wanted to go outside the bounds of a normal research methodology in human-computer interaction class assignment 2 to research a theory that would not only have an impact on our degree but also an impact on how one may proceed to train retain information in the day to day life,
such as remembering grocery list. Consequently, we came across the idea of comparing whether it was better to hand write notes to retain information or to type notes out.</p>
<h2 id="tristan-borja">Tristan Borja</h2>
<p>The completion of this assignment has integrated notable skills presented by the team and myself. Personally, I was able to provide some knowledge of data mining into the assignment and share my experience with other team members, specifically towards Rhys - who has been a substantial amount of help throughout the analysis section. Rhys and I were able to produce significant content for analysis that we believe would suffice the criteria of the assignment. Though, with my studies under the Data Mining and Knowledge Engineering paper, I could have provided a better choice of graphs. An example would be the variable choices for the correlation graph. Considering the emphasis on data analysis, I could have planned the team’s experiment more effectively as we lacked a secondary variable for the correlation graph. Though, I believe Rhys and I were able to compensate with a reasonable variable for our correlation graph.</p>
<p>I was given the task of video editing, regardless of my small experience with editing software such as Adobe Premiere. Many YouTube tutorials made it possible for me to familiarize myself with these features. I have learned the many features that Adobe Premiere provides for video editing. An example is the cut feature to split a video clip into two halves. Another example is the efficient ways of transitioning from one video clip to another. All these features are proven to be beneficial to the team as the recorded videos of our experiment contained irrelevant content that is not very useful for the assignment.</p>
<p>In regards to research, I found that I have a very little impact towards the investigation of research methodologies. All credit due to Rhys and Sonic for making it possible for me to understand the assignment in respects to this area. I was able to learn about differences between quantitative and qualitative approaches. A quantitative approach focusing on measuring outcome through the use of easy to understand questions and a large population. Alternative, Qualitative approach is a more in-depth by focusing on measuring outcome based on the quality of descriptive questions. Overall, both approaches have a specific role when it comes to producing reliable statistics. Therefore, the team as appropriate some aspects of the two approaches towards the experiment.</p>
<p>Although I lack knowledge towards research methodologies during the beginning of the assignment, I believe my contribution towards the proposal is satisfying. Being able to provide my experience in written work, I was able to produce the team’s invitation for the information sheet. It may not seem up to standards in terms of team contribution compared to the other teammates, but I believe I also exhausted sufficient effort towards producing the information sheet. Through this, I have learned that contribution can be satisfactory regardless of the amount of work done by oneself. </p>
<p>In other areas of research, I have learned many facts about memory. Especially, the difference between short-term and long-term memory. As our theory is related to memory due to retaining information, some research in this area is required to support our claims. With the assistance of other students from the Applied Human and Computer Interaction paper in respects to their presentation during a tutorial,  I have learned is short-term memory demonstrates temporal decay and capability limits as opposed to long term which demonstrates greater storage of information by size and is permanent. The significance of this information is directed to studying and how students are required to exert effort to retain information for long-term use otherwise that information dissipates. Other facts such as the short-term memory having the capacity of storing information of 5-9 random and unrelated objects are just as important.</p>
<p>Personally, my role in conducting the experiment can be arguably sufficient. Due to time constraints, I was unable to conduct, or at least contribute to most of the experiment. Though, I believe my example in running the experiment to Vivian and Sonic ensure they knew how to guide the student through partaking the experiment. The take-home in this note is the requirement to improve time management so that I will be able to contribute equally towards the assignment.</p>
<p>In comparison to other group assignments, I believe this assignment could do with some improvement. Referring to my group from my IT Project Management group assignment, the team showed excellent time management, collaboration, and quality assurance. These factors come with good planning and ensuring the team is well aware of the goals of the assignment. Good planning is important for execution as it reflects the preparation of undertaking the assignment. Although this team has planned well for the experiment and the report, I believe we can improve in this area of the assignment. It is also important to note initiative. Sonic is a good representation of someone who takes initiative and has set an example for me to take into other projects or assignments.</p>
<p>I have very little experience in the IT Industry. Though, with the executions of assignments and group projects, I now have a brief understanding of what the industry is like outside of the university. It can be very stressful with many factors to take into consideration, but with motivation, preparation, and commitment, I believe the industry outside of university is not as difficult as everyone expects. Experiencing many projects, I can claim to be prepared for future projects. What I need to work on is the commitment I need towards a project.</p>

<p>Upon the completion of this assignment, myself and the team had to learn a tremendous amount of knowledge, in which I can now apply to other assessments coming up.  At the beginning I was required to investigate the two different exploration methodology techniques; qualitative and quantitative. And find the best course of action when given the research topic we undertook and then finding the best way to usability test the methodology. When it came to intermingling with participants, I had already previously required the skills set that allowed me to communicate with the participants correctly for them to complete the testing with ease. Additionally, this assignment was the perfect chance for myself to test the skills that I have learned throughout my computer science degree and see what may need to be worked in the future.</p>
<p>When first thinking of the main research question with the team, I learned that the question that we were trying to backup with information actually needed to be achievable. It was easy to make a clause which related to human-computer interaction, but the real challenge for me was making a research question that was different from other groups and achievable. This further allowed me to develop my skill set of critical thinking and put it to test during this stage of the project.</p>
<p>Furthermore, collecting information at the end of the project allowed me to bring in several skills that I had already required from previous papers to discuss the findings we had to make predictions. Although we chose qualitative as our research methodology due to only having to use a limited number of participants to complete the testing stage. It may have been wiser to have a wider range of participants, which would have allowed a better analysis stage to create predictions that were more efficient and reliable. However, I still believe the end outcome of the analysis is correct and has enough elaboration.</p>
<p>Additionally, when trying to create a usability test for participants, I and the team had to research the best course of action to try test one's ability to retain information. I learned that review questions were actually a big part of the testing stage as they allowed for a deeper analysis, which led on to making predictions. Also trying to conduct the best way to test a person’s ability to retain information when applied to human-computer interaction was a big struggle for myself. Having to research an unknown topic that I had no prior knowledge actually allowed me to learn the best ways of finding information online, in which I can now take on board in the future when trying to finding topics I am unsure about. However, after researching several different sources, a way in which we could test this came about and seemed to be work successfully when gathering data after testing the participant.</p>
<p>Also working with people that I worked with on the previous assignment allowed effective communication to be used throughout this assignment as everyone knew each other and was not scared to communicate with one another, which can be a challenge for new groups. </p>
<p>Lastly, this assignment allowed me to obtain skills in which I can take into the future. Although I am taking computer science, having the ability to communicate with different nationalities is a must in any job in the world and this assignment further allowed me to touch on these skills and develop them more.</p></div>
