<p>We are just of dying students :(</p>
<h2 id="why-we-chose-this-project">Why we chose this project?</h2>
<p>As a team we decided that we wanted to research and analyze a topic that would further better our studies,
most groups were already speed testing keyboards and comparing screen sizes.
However, we wanted to go outside the bounds of a normal research methodology in human-computer interaction class assignment 2 to research a theory that would not only have an impact on our degree but also an impact on how one may proceed to train retain information in the day to day life,
such as remembering grocery list. Consequently, we came across the idea of comparing whether it was better to hand write notes to retain information or to type notes out.</p>
<h2 id="tristan-borja">Tristan Borja</h2>
<p>The completion of this assignment has integrated notable skills presented by the team and myself. Personally, I was able to provide some knowledge of data mining into the assignment and share my experience with other team members, specifically towards Rhys - who has been a substantial amount of help throughout the analysis section. Rhys and I were able to produce significant content for analysis that we believe would suffice the criteria of the assignment. Though, with my studies under the Data Mining and Knowledge Engineering paper, I could have provided a better choice of graphs. An example would be the variable choices for the correlation graph. Considering the emphasis on data analysis, I could have planned the team’s experiment more effectively as we lacked a secondary variable for the correlation graph. Though, I believe Rhys and I were able to compensate with a reasonable variable for our correlation graph.</p>
<p>I was given the task of video editing, regardless of my small experience with editing software such as Adobe Premiere. Many YouTube tutorials made it possible for me to familiarize myself with these features. I have learned the many features that Adobe Premiere provides for video editing. An example is the cut feature to split a video clip into two halves. Another example is the efficient ways of transitioning from one video clip to another. All these features are proven to be beneficial to the team as the recorded videos of our experiment contained irrelevant content that is not very useful for the assignment.</p>
<p>In regards to research, I found that I have a very little impact towards the investigation of research methodologies. All credit due to Rhys and Sonic for making it possible for me to understand the assignment in respects to this area. I was able to learn about differences between quantitative and qualitative approaches. A quantitative approach focusing on measuring outcome through the use of easy to understand questions and a large population. Alternative, Qualitative approach is a more in-depth by focusing on measuring outcome based on the quality of descriptive questions. Overall, both approaches have a specific role when it comes to producing reliable statistics. Therefore, the team as appropriate some aspects of the two approaches towards the experiment.</p>
<p>Although I lack knowledge towards research methodologies during the beginning of the assignment, I believe my contribution towards the proposal is satisfying. Being able to provide my experience in written work, I was able to produce the team’s invitation for the information sheet. It may not seem up to standards in terms of team contribution compared to the other teammates, but I believe I also exhausted sufficient effort towards producing the information sheet. Through this, I have learned that contribution can be satisfactory regardless of the amount of work done by oneself. </p>
<p>In other areas of research, I have learned many facts about memory. Especially, the difference between short-term and long-term memory. As our theory is related to memory due to retaining information, some research in this area is required to support our claims. With the assistance of other students from the Applied Human and Computer Interaction paper in respects to their presentation during a tutorial,  I have learned is short-term memory demonstrates temporal decay and capability limits as opposed to long term which demonstrates greater storage of information by size and is permanent. The significance of this information is directed to studying and how students are required to exert effort to retain information for long-term use otherwise that information dissipates. Other facts such as the short-term memory having the capacity of storing information of 5-9 random and unrelated objects are just as important.</p>
<p>Personally, my role in conducting the experiment can be arguably sufficient. Due to time constraints, I was unable to conduct, or at least contribute to most of the experiment. Though, I believe my example in running the experiment to Vivian and Sonic ensure they knew how to guide the student through partaking the experiment. The take-home in this note is the requirement to improve time management so that I will be able to contribute equally towards the assignment.</p>
<p>In comparison to other group assignments, I believe this assignment could do with some improvement. Referring to my group from my IT Project Management group assignment, the team showed excellent time management, collaboration, and quality assurance. These factors come with good planning and ensuring the team is well aware of the goals of the assignment. Good planning is important for execution as it reflects the preparation of undertaking the assignment. Although this team has planned well for the experiment and the report, I believe we can improve in this area of the assignment. It is also important to note initiative. Sonic is a good representation of someone who takes initiative and has set an example for me to take into other projects or assignments.</p>
<p>I have very little experience in the IT Industry. Though, with the executions of assignments and group projects, I now have a brief understanding of what the industry is like outside of the university. It can be very stressful with many factors to take into consideration, but with motivation, preparation, and commitment, I believe the industry outside of university is not as difficult as everyone expects. Experiencing many projects, I can claim to be prepared for future projects. What I need to work on is the commitment I need towards a project.</p>
<h2 id="rhys-ah-colt">Rhys Ah Colt</h2>
<p>Upon the completion of this assignment, myself and the team had to learn a tremendous amount of knowledge, in which I can now apply to other assessments coming up.  At the beginning I was required to investigate the two different exploration methodology techniques; qualitative and quantitative. And find the best course of action when given the research topic we undertook and then finding the best way to usability test the methodology. When it came to intermingling with participants, I had already previously required the skills set that allowed me to communicate with the participants correctly for them to complete the testing with ease. Additionally, this assignment was the perfect chance for myself to test the skills that I have learned throughout my computer science degree and see what may need to be worked in the future.</p>
<p>When first thinking of the main research question with the team, I learned that the question that we were trying to backup with information actually needed to be achievable. It was easy to make a clause which related to human-computer interaction, but the real challenge for me was making a research question that was different from other groups and achievable. This further allowed me to develop my skill set of critical thinking and put it to test during this stage of the project.</p>
<p>Furthermore, collecting information at the end of the project allowed me to bring in several skills that I had already required from previous papers to discuss the findings we had to make predictions. Although we chose qualitative as our research methodology due to only having to use a limited number of participants to complete the testing stage. It may have been wiser to have a wider range of participants, which would have allowed a better analysis stage to create predictions that were more efficient and reliable. However, I still believe the end outcome of the analysis is correct and has enough elaboration.</p>
<p>Additionally, when trying to create a usability test for participants, I and the team had to research the best course of action to try test one's ability to retain information. I learned that review questions were actually a big part of the testing stage as they allowed for a deeper analysis, which led on to making predictions. Also trying to conduct the best way to test a person’s ability to retain information when applied to human-computer interaction was a big struggle for myself. Having to research an unknown topic that I had no prior knowledge actually allowed me to learn the best ways of finding information online, in which I can now take on board in the future when trying to finding topics I am unsure about. However, after researching several different sources, a way in which we could test this came about and seemed to be work successfully when gathering data after testing the participant.</p>
<p>Also working with people that I worked with on the previous assignment allowed effective communication to be used throughout this assignment as everyone knew each other and was not scared to communicate with one another, which can be a challenge for new groups. </p>
<p>Lastly, this assignment allowed me to obtain skills in which I can take into the future. Although I am taking computer science, having the ability to communicate with different nationalities is a must in any job in the world and this assignment further allowed me to touch on these skills and develop them more.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong>  </p>
<p>In the beginning of this assignment I decided to take initiative and lead the group in a way where we progressed from the start a bit, while progress was slow, it still progressed. 
I decided to take action and research up on the research methodologies to figure out what we wanted, but before that we had to figure out what we wanted to test usability for, in the start we thought keyboards would be a good idea, to test the backlight keyboard if it is really usable in a dark room or was it for appearance purposes.</p>
<p>After that we found out that there were a lot of people doing keyboard experiments and thought it would be bland to do keyboard as everyone else was doing it, so we decided to test memory with our usability test. What we do every day, study, learn, we wanted to research which would be a better method to test it out.</p>
<p><strong>What went right</strong>  </p>
<p>We started out the project going strong, but progress was still slow, we didn't know much about quantitative or qualitative or even how to study the data we have to analyze but progress kept at the same pace and did not stop which was good.
Usually, I check where we were at each week and what we have to do to complete this project. This keeps us going.</p>
<p>Our research finding for previous research findings was easy to read and easy to find and there were a lot of resources to find. We found one particularly interesting one, which is a video and an article. We decided to imitate the experiment for it to make sure that our experiment was valid but we changed it a bit depending on our environment.</p>
<p>Creating the website was my part to do, it went well I had used a template to create the website, but I had to wait for everything to be written out so I can add items to the web page, I wanted to help with the analysis but had no time to help my team as assignments were dawning on me.
I’d like to say that the teamwork in this team was splendid, no conflict, we had progressed and we discussed things together to figure out what we would do for this assignment. Tristan was very cooperative with me assigning tasks to be and-and saying what needs to be done, Rhys did the work that was assigned to him and delivered before things were due. Lastly, Vivian did a good job at proofreading our work and analyzing videos for us.</p>
<p><strong>What went wrong</strong> </p>
<p>While we did a pre-test to our experiment we had many flaws in our experiments such as a lot of variables, the environment change, the noise and lastly interruptions by the outside environment. After the pre-test, we decided to refine the questions a bit and add in a survey at the end to get more data from the people, which went well but we may have needed a little bit more data. </p>
<p>Our meetings were mostly online on hangouts which prevented us from interacting with each other at the most, we just discussed what we were going to do and how we are going to do it. We certainly could have had more meetings to improve our work as the experiment, we rarely have any time as the due date was dawning on us.</p>
<p><strong>What did I learn</strong>  </p>
<p>I learned about the methodologies involved in researching and how hard this would be, in the beginning, I found a whole bunch of pdf on research methodologies and shared it with the team.</p>
<p>I learned that we needed to prepare our experiment out more before doing the experiment and figure out what we will obtain once the experiment is done.
Relation
This paper related to the IT Project Management paper where I could use my skills from that paper to lead this team a bit in the right direction.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>  </p>
<p>In Conclusion, I would say I have learned a lot in this project from learning to initiate projects to research methodologies to how an experiment will work, I believe these skills will help me in the future as a person.</p>

<p>A lot of research was needed for this paper and throughout this assignment, my group had gained an exceptional amount of knowledge regarding the aspects of Human and Computer interaction. Although we were quite early in choosing a topic based on backlit keyboards, it soon came clear to us how popular keyboard topics were and so we had decided to think of a new topic. It was a bit of a challenge for us but in the end we decided to go with the study of note taking by Longhand writing versus typing out notes. </p>
<p>We proceeded with a Qualitative approach on the topic and carried out a quiz-based experiment on each participant while also recording their behaviour and actions throughout the duration of the experiment. Initially I had thought that most people would choose typing over handwritten notes however, I was proved wrong as the experiment kicked off and most participants stated they prefer handwritten notes over digital notes. Prior to the experiments, we researched over many topics regarding the study of memory and found an especially helpful video on an interview that explained a research that found out that although note-taking by typing notes is faster (for certain people of course), hand-written notes help more with retaining long term memory. </p>
<p>Our team did not have much time to gather participants, however we believe the data collected is sufficient enough and displays the results we had expected to see. It was a good idea to carry out a ‘pre-test’ on a friend to determine what variables would affect our experiment before starting the actual experimental phase. I have learnt that although it might seem pointless at times to record a participant while they are doing work, it is absolutely necessary during behavioural studies as you can receive an insight of the opinions and thoughts of the participant that can affect the outlook of the overall results. </p>
<p>The relation of our experiment to AHCI is where society is rapidly adapting and evolving along with our daily lives to provide more convenient solutions to improve our lifestyles. There are many digital ways to take down notes which are important to us if we want to note down sudden meetings, deadlines or even shopping lists. Nowadays, not many people carry pens and papers around with them but rather a phone or digital tablet that which is more convenient, compared to around 10 years ago where technology was not as advanced. Although many people prefer to take down physical notes in lectures and meetings, there are just as many people that prefer note taking with digital notes.</p>
<p>Overall our team did not have many issues and were comfortable with working together on the project. Although we were busy at times due to our hectic schedules, we had video calls and constant Facebook chat updates with each other to keep each person in the loop throughout the duration of the assignment.</p></div>
