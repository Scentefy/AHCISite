Qualitative methodology allowed the team to understand the reasons, motivators and opinions about each participant conducting this experiment (Patton, 2005)  Thus this methodology guided the team to help develop ideas for testing. Furthermore it also allowed the team to undercover the trends, opinions and thoughts during the testing stage, such as the person's preference of what they usually use to take notes and if the video was played too quickly. Thus this further allowed us to analyse the data more effectively when it came to doing so. Due to time constraints and other impediments the team faced, qualitative allowed us to only have a small sample size of participants, which seemed to work well in this project. \n\n\nCollection methods we used to collect data included taking videos of the participants during the duration of the experiment. This allowed us to analyse the behaviours, thoughts and comments the participants made which gave us an insight of why certain participants found our experiment difficult. An example is \u2018Student H\u2019 where although they are studious and smart, they mentioned that are not good at hand-writing or typing out notes and therefore had a lot of trouble throughout our experiment. Another example of how footage of a participant can give you insight of the data is the difference of confidence levels between each participant when note taking, where a calm participant could be taking down notes at ease with no struggles, whereas a flustered participant will rush through writing their notes and make small comments of confusion.

            "text": "Analysis\n\n\nThe experiment consisted of 12 students.\nEach participant was tested in one of two ways;\ntaking notes down on paper or taking notes down on a keyboard before taking a quiz.\nThe experiment was successfully completed over all students. Data was extracted from the experiment based on the answers provided by the students.\nThe data will serve as important information that will be analyzed, providing evidence on whether the use of personal computers improves their ability to retain information. \n\n\nQuestion Analysis\n\n\nFigure 2 provides a statistical graph, providing information on a number of students that answered a question correctly.\nThe answers given by the students can vary, especially to the questions that require the student to type in their answer.\nThough, the research team accepted any answers that are relative to the expected answer.\nThis is especially all questions excluding 1, 6 and 9. Answers can also be considered partially correct specifically towards questions that require two possibilities.\nFor example, question 10 requires the student to name the first and last fact of the video. If a student successfully provides one of the correct answers,\nit\u2019ll be considered partially correct.\nAnswers to question 7 could also be considered partially correct due to how the student well the student answered the question.  \n\n\nBased on Figure 2, we can see that majority of students were able to answer most of the single answer questions. Question 2 shows that all students were able to successfully provide the correct answer. The content of question 2 has very little information to talk about, which could be the very reason why it maintained a 100% correction rate. Tri (n.d.) states in his blog that short-term memory is capable of holding information about 5 to 9 unrelated objects. In the case of this examination, students choose to retain simple information, such as single, short answered questions. This can be shown as 7 of the 10 questions hold a correction count of 50% or more. Though, many other factors may be included that explains this phenomenon.\n\n\nQuestions that require a more descriptive or multiple answers show a lower count in correct answers. Though, with the inclusion of partially correct answers, most students were able to answer the question partially correctly. Therefore, if the questions were treated as single answered questions, the correct answer count for questions 3 and 10 would increase substantially. The reason for these questions to have a low correct answer count is due to the possibilities of a student to answering the question correctly has been reduced. The more that is needed for the answer, the less likely for the student to achieve a fully correct answer. As mentioned previously, answers to question 7 can also be treated as partially correct. It requires a relatively descriptive answer as the wording of the answer is important to achieve a fully correct answer. With descriptive answers, it is entirely up to the examiner\u2019s judgment on whether an answer is correct. Brown (2001) explains that descriptive answers are costly, slow and suffer from variation of human judgment. Table 1 shows the answers of students for question 7. The criteria for an answer to be fully correct is the inclusion of the words \u201creplace\u201d, \u201call\u201d and \u201ccell\u201d. Students that fail to present all 3 keywords are classified as partially correct or incorrect. Though, an exception is given to Student A as he/she included the word \u201cregenerate\u201d, having a synonym of recreate. As a result, 5 students was successful to provide the required keywords whereas 6 students provided some of these words and 1 student provided the incorrect answer.\n\n\nTable 1. All answers to question 7 including classification of its correctness.\n\n\n  \n\n\nFigure 2. Stacked plot rendition of the amount of students that got each question correct.\n\n\n  \n\n\nPreference in Note Taking\n\n\nFor reliability of results from the experiment, the research team aimed to balance the students that use personal computers and long written notes.\nThough, majority of the students prefer the use of long written notes, especially when studying. \nFigure 1 shows the statistics of students that prefer the longhand and typed notes during lectures, the experiment and studying for exams. \nThe graph shows that 7/12 students that partook on the experiment prefer to use longhand as oppose to typed notes. Though, they do not always use this method for other purposes such as lectures and studying for exams.\n\n\nFigure 3. Histogram rendition of Note Taking Preference for the experiment, lectures and studying for exams.\n\n\n  \n\n\nFigure 4. Box plot rendition of score comparison between longhand and typed notes.\n\n\n  \n\n\nFigure 5. Bar chart that shows the difficulties of the test with regards to the prescribed material.\n\n\n  \n\n\nFrom the above statistics, the above graph (Figure 5) displays that there was a 23% increment of difficulty when finding the test hard while using a keyboard to note take when comparing it to participants who found the test hard using a pen paper. Accordingly, this evidentially shows that almost everyone that was using a keyboard to take notes thought that the quiz was hard, therefore supporting the main research question that people tend to hold retain information better when using handwritten notes when compared to a keyboard.    \n\n\nFurthermore, the reason behind this increment may be due to the fact that, traditionally people who try to retain information typically use hand written material instead of typing. Thus 50% of people that were experimented and found the test hard when using a keyboard, use handwritten material when trying to study or note take for a test, additionally, 90% of them also takes notes during lectures. The reasoning as to why they had difficulty with the test may be due to the fact that they traditionally use hand written notes to study before a test and for note taking during lectures.Consequently backing up this clause that note taking using pen and paper to retain information is better when compared to typing the notes out. Additionally, humans tend to withhold information better when one creates the motion within their hand, this is due to the human having to direct movement by thought instead of just having to push buttons, thus the information is more embedded into the human mind (Chemin, 2014). Consequently, this could have an effect on why participants found the test hard when using the keyboard as it does not stimulate this way of retaining information (Wax, 2015). As for the other 50% that found the test hard when having to type notes, the data shows that 90% of that 50% do not actually take notes when in lectures. When taking the last statement into account,  this factor could be the reason behind them finding the test difficult as they don't have the same skills as someone who takes notes in the lecture to retain information. \n\n\nFigure 6:  This bar chart represents the time 4 random participants from both sides of  test took to complete the test.\n\n \n  \n\n\nAs shown above, the graph portrays that participants took longer to answer the questions when using pen and paper when compared to using a keyboard. Typically as stated in above statement about figure 6, you have a better recollection of memory when writing it down(Chemin, 2014). Therefore the longer periods could be due to the person trying to recollect and process what they have previously written down to study before answering the question. Whereas the people who used a laptop completed the test faster, thus the reasoning behind this may be due to the fact that the notes they took down about the video were only stored in their short-term memory. This may be due to the participant not actually having to perform any major cognitive process that would allow the participant to store information in the brain, although we can't tell if the participant used imagery to help store this information, it seems reasonable this was the probable cause as to why they took a shorter amount of time.  \n\n\nFigure 7. Correlation plot rendition of average score comparison. Arranged from left to right is most most overall \n\ncorrect answer count to least overall correct answer count.\n\n\n  \n\n\nAs you can see in the above linear Regression graph. It seems reasonable that you can make the prediction that using a pen and paper is the best way to retain information. The longhand regression line clearly shows a higher average correction rate of 0.8 when compared to the  average correction rate of the typed regression line, that being 0.6.  Taking this into account it evidently backs up our clause that using hand written notes is better than using a keyboard to retain information, Ideally having more participants and an even number of contributors may have lead to a better analysis and a more in-depth understanding as to why this relationship may have occurred,  however given the data which was analysed and referring it to the above graph, it still seems reasonable for one to say that using pen and paper is the best way for one to retain information. \n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nIn conclusion, the above figures and analysis to go with the graph have enough detail to show that hand written notes are better for retaining information over a short period of time.",

Consequently, we came across the idea of comparing whether it was better to hand write notes to retain information or to type notes out.\n\n\nTristan Borja\n\n\nThe completion of this assignment has integrated notable skills presented by the team and myself. Personally, I was able to provide some knowledge of data mining into the assignment and share my experience with other team members, specifically towards Rhys - who has been a substantial amount of help throughout the analysis section. Rhys and I were able to produce significant content for analysis that we believe would suffice the criteria of the assignment. Though, with my studies under the Data Mining and Knowledge Engineering paper, I could have provided a better choice of graphs. An example would be the variable choices for the correlation graph. Considering the emphasis on data analysis, I could have planned the team\u2019s experiment more effectively as we lacked a secondary variable for the correlation graph. Though, I believe Rhys and I were able to compensate with a reasonable variable for our correlation graph.\n\n\nI was given the task of video editing, regardless of my small experience with editing software such as Adobe Premiere. Many YouTube tutorials made it possible for me to familiarize myself with these features. I have learned the many features that Adobe Premiere provides for video editing. An example is the cut feature to split a video clip into two halves. Another example is the efficient ways of transitioning from one video clip to another. All these features are proven to be beneficial to the team as the recorded videos of our experiment contained irrelevant content that is not very useful for the assignment.\n\n\nIn regards to research, I found that I have a very little impact towards the investigation of research methodologies. All credit due to Rhys and Sonic for making it possible for me to understand the assignment in respects to this area. I was able to learn about differences between quantitative and qualitative approaches. A quantitative approach focusing on measuring outcome through the use of easy to understand questions and a large population. Alternative, Qualitative approach is a more in-depth by focusing on measuring outcome based on the quality of descriptive questions. Overall, both approaches have a specific role when it comes to producing reliable statistics. Therefore, the team as appropriate some aspects of the two approaches towards the experiment.\n\n\nAlthough I lack knowledge towards research methodologies during the beginning of the assignment, I believe my contribution towards the proposal is satisfying. Being able to provide my experience in written work, I was able to produce the team\u2019s invitation for the information sheet. It may not seem up to standards in terms of team contribution compared to the other teammates, but I believe I also exhausted sufficient effort towards producing the information sheet. Through this, I have learned that contribution can be satisfactory regardless of the amount of work done by oneself. \n\n\nIn other areas of research, I have learned many facts about memory. Especially, the difference between short-term and long-term memory. As our theory is related to memory due to retaining information, some research in this area is required to support our claims. With the assistance of other students from the Applied Human and Computer Interaction paper in respects to their presentation during a tutorial,  I have learned is short-term memory demonstrates temporal decay and capability limits as opposed to long term which demonstrates greater storage of information by size and is permanent. The significance of this information is directed to studying and how students are required to exert effort to retain information for long-term use otherwise that information dissipates. Other facts such as the short-term memory having the capacity of storing information of 5-9 random and unrelated objects are just as important.\n\n\nPersonally, my role in conducting the experiment can be arguably sufficient. Due to time constraints, I was unable to conduct, or at least contribute to most of the experiment. Though, I believe my example in running the experiment to Vivian and Sonic ensure they knew how to guide the student through partaking the experiment. The take-home in this note is the requirement to improve time management so that I will be able to contribute equally towards the assignment.\n\n\nIn comparison to other group assignments, I believe this assignment could do with some improvement. Referring to my group from my IT Project Management group assignment, the team showed excellent time management, collaboration, and quality assurance. These factors come with good planning and ensuring the team is well aware of the goals of the assignment. Good planning is important for execution as it reflects the preparation of undertaking the assignment. Although this team has planned well for the experiment and the report, I believe we can improve in this area of the assignment. It is also important to note initiative. Sonic is a good representation of someone who takes initiative and has set an example for me to take into other projects or assignments.\n\n\nI have very little experience in the IT Industry. Though, with the executions of assignments and group projects, I now have a brief understanding of what the industry is like outside of the university. It can be very stressful with many factors to take into consideration, but with motivation, preparation, and commitment, I believe the industry outside of university is not as difficult as everyone expects. Experiencing many projects, I can claim to be prepared for future projects. What I need to work on is the commitment I need towards a project.\n\n\nRhys Ah Colt\n\n\nUpon the completion of this assignment, myself and the team had to learn a tremendous amount of knowledge, in which I can now apply to other assessments coming up.  At the beginning I was required to investigate the two different exploration methodology techniques; qualitative and quantitative. And find the best course of action when given the research topic we undertook and then finding the best way to usability test the methodology. When it came to intermingling with participants, I had already previously required the skills set that allowed me to communicate with the participants correctly for them to complete the testing with ease. Additionally, this assignment was the perfect chance for myself to test the skills that I have learned throughout my computer science degree and see what may need to be worked in the future.\n\n\nWhen first thinking of the main research question with the team, I learned that the question that we were trying to backup with information actually needed to be achievable. It was easy to make a clause which related to human-computer interaction, but the real challenge for me was making a research question that was different from other groups and achievable. This further allowed me to develop my skill set of critical thinking and put it to test during this stage of the project.\n\n\nFurthermore, collecting information at the end of the project allowed me to bring in several skills that I had already required from previous papers to discuss the findings we had to make predictions. Although we chose qualitative as our research methodology due to only having to use a limited number of participants to complete the testing stage. It may have been wiser to have a wider range of participants, which would have allowed a better analysis stage to create predictions that were more efficient and reliable. However, I still believe the end outcome of the analysis is correct and has enough elaboration.\n\n\nAdditionally, when trying to create a usability test for participants, I and the team had to research the best course of action to try test one's ability to retain information. I learned that review questions were actually a big part of the testing stage as they allowed for a deeper analysis, which led on to making predictions. Also trying to conduct the best way to test a person\u2019s ability to retain information when applied to human-computer interaction was a big struggle for myself. Having to research an unknown topic that I had no prior knowledge actually allowed me to learn the best ways of finding information online, in which I can now take on board in the future when trying to finding topics I am unsure about. However, after researching several different sources, a way in which we could test this came about and seemed to be work successfully when gathering data after testing the participant.\n\n\nAlso working with people that I worked with on the previous assignment allowed effective communication to be used throughout this assignment as everyone knew each other and was not scared to communicate with one another, which can be a challenge for new groups. \n\n\nLastly, this assignment allowed me to obtain skills in which I can take into the future. Although I am taking computer science, having the ability to communicate with different nationalities is a must in any job in the world and this assignment further allowed me to touch on these skills and develop them more.\n\n\nSonic Phachansiri\n\n\nIntroduction\n  \n\n\nIn the beginning of this assignment I decided to take initiative and lead the group in a way where we progressed from the start a bit, while progress was slow, it still progressed. \nI decided to take action and research up on the research methodologies to figure out what we wanted, but before that we had to figure out what we wanted to test usability for, in the start we thought keyboards would be a good idea, to test the backlight keyboard if it is really usable in a dark room or was it for appearance purposes.\n\n\nAfter that we found out that there were a lot of people doing keyboard experiments and thought it would be bland to do keyboard as everyone else was doing it, so we decided to test memory with our usability test. What we do every day, study, learn, we wanted to research which would be a better method to test it out.\n\n\nWhat went right\n  \n\n\nWe started out the project going strong, but progress was still slow, we didn't know much about quantitative or qualitative or even how to study the data we have to analyze but progress kept at the same pace and did not stop which was good.\nUsually, I check where we were at each week and what we have to do to complete this project. This keeps us going.\n\n\nOur research finding for previous research findings was easy to read and easy to find and there were a lot of resources to find. We found one particularly interesting one, which is a video and an article. We decided to imitate the experiment for it to make sure that our experiment was valid but we changed it a bit depending on our environment.\n\n\nCreating the website was my part to do, it went well I had used a template to create the website, but I had to wait for everything to be written out so I can add items to the web page, I wanted to help with the analysis but had no time to help my team as assignments were dawning on me.\nI\u2019d like to say that the teamwork in this team was splendid, no conflict, we had progressed and we discussed things together to figure out what we would do for this assignment. Tristan was very cooperative with me assigning tasks to be and-and saying what needs to be done, Rhys did the work that was assigned to him and delivered before things were due. Lastly, Vivian did a good job at proofreading our work and analyzing videos for us.\n\n\nWhat went wrong\n \n\n\nWhile we did a pre-test to our experiment we had many flaws in our experiments such as a lot of variables, the environment change, the noise and lastly interruptions by the outside environment. After the pre-test, we decided to refine the questions a bit and add in a survey at the end to get more data from the people, which went well but we may have needed a little bit more data. \n\n\nOur meetings were mostly online on hangouts which prevented us from interacting with each other at the most, we just discussed what we were going to do and how we are going to do it. We certainly could have had more meetings to improve our work as the experiment, we rarely have any time as the due date was dawning on us.\n\n\nWhat did I learn\n  \n\n\nI learned about the methodologies involved in researching and how hard this would be, in the beginning, I found a whole bunch of pdf on research methodologies and shared it with the team.\n\n\nI learned that we needed to prepare our experiment out more before doing the experiment and figure out what we will obtain once the experiment is done.\nRelation\nThis paper related to the IT Project Management paper where I could use my skills from that paper to lead this team a bit in the right direction.\n\n\nConclusion\n  \n\n\nIn Conclusion, I would say I have learned a lot in this project from learning to initiate projects to research methodologies to how an experiment will work, I believe these skills will help me in the future as a person.\n\n\nVivian Ngo\n\n\nA lot of research was needed for this paper and throughout this assignment, my group had gained an exceptional amount of knowledge regarding the aspects of Human and Computer interaction. Although we were quite early in choosing a topic based on backlit keyboards, it soon came clear to us how popular keyboard topics were and so we had decided to think of a new topic. It was a bit of a challenge for us but in the end we decided to go with the study of note taking by Longhand writing versus typing out notes. \n\n\nWe proceeded with a Qualitative approach on the topic and carried out a quiz-based experiment on each participant while also recording their behaviour and actions throughout the duration of the experiment. Initially I had thought that most people would choose typing over handwritten notes however, I was proved wrong as the experiment kicked off and most participants stated they prefer handwritten notes over digital notes. Prior to the experiments, we researched over many topics regarding the study of memory and found an especially helpful video on an interview that explained a research that found out that although note-taking by typing notes is faster (for certain people of course), hand-written notes help more with retaining long term memory. \n\n\nOur team did not have much time to gather participants, however we believe the data collected is sufficient enough and displays the results we had expected to see. It was a good idea to carry out a \u2018pre-test\u2019 on a friend to determine what variables would affect our experiment before starting the actual experimental phase. I have learnt that although it might seem pointless at times to record a participant while they are doing work, it is absolutely necessary during behavioural studies as you can receive an insight of the opinions and thoughts of the participant that can affect the outlook of the overall results. \n\n\nThe relation of our experiment to AHCI is where society is rapidly adapting and evolving along with our daily lives to provide more convenient solutions to improve our lifestyles. There are many digital ways to take down notes which are important to us if we want to note down sudden meetings, deadlines or even shopping lists. Nowadays, not many people carry pens and papers around with them but rather a phone or digital tablet that which is more convenient, compared to around 10 years ago where technology was not as advanced. Although many people prefer to take down physical notes in lectures and meetings, there are just as many people that prefer note taking with digital notes.\n\n\nOverall our team did not have many issues and were comfortable with working together on the project. Although we were busy at times due to our hectic schedules, we had video calls and constant Facebook chat updates with each other to keep each person in the loop throughout the duration of the assignment.",
